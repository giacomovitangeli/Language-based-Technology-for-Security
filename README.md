# Language-based-Technology-for-Security
Projects for Language-based Technology for Security class in Cybersecurity.

## Project 1: Trusted Execution Environment for Mobile Code
The goal of this project is to design and build in OCAML the trusted execution environment of a functional language with linguistic primitives for mobile code and secure programming.

The trusted execution environment must include:
- The interpreter of the language
- Run-time modules that provide facilities needed to control and enforce the
security policies constraining access to local resources by mobile code.
