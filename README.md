# Trusted Execution Environment for Mobile Code
Projects for Language-based Technology for Security class in Cybersecurity.
The goal is to design and build in OCAML a trusted execution environment of a functional language with linguistic primitives for mobile code and secure programming.

The trusted execution environment must include:
- The interpreter of the language.
- Run-time modules that provide facilities needed to control and enforce the security policies constraining access to local resources by mobile code.
